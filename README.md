# Ivanti Data Import Node.js Application

## Overview

The Ivanti Data Import Node.js Application is a background tool designed to automate the process of importing data from CSV and Excel files into the Ivanti API. This application is intended to run as a service, periodically importing data without user intervention.

## Features

- Automate the import of data from CSV and Excel files into your Ivanti instance.
- Map CSV/Excel columns to Ivanti API fields for each import job.
- Perform data validation before submission to ensure data integrity.
- Log import progress and errors for auditing purposes.
- Supports various authentication methods for Ivanti API access.
- Configurable scheduling for automated imports.

## Getting Started
